TransMeta constructs the novel vector-weighted splicing graph model, in which the edges and nodes are weighted by vectors rather than single numbers with the element in kth position of the vectors being the corresponding weight in sample k. And TransMeta employs a cosine-similarity based combing strategy and label setting algorithm to recover the transcripts. TransMeta takes a file that lists the alignment files(Bam format) of multiple RNA-seq samples as input, and outputs all assembled candidate transcripts in GTF format.\nFunctions: RNA-Seq quantification, RNA-seq read count analysis, Sequence assembly\nTopics: Gene expression, RNA-Seq, Sequence assembly\nHomepage: https://github.com/yutingsdu/TransMeta\nDocumentation: \n",

SpCLUST extends a previously released software by integrating additional scoring matrices which enables it to cover the clustering of amino-acid sequences. The similarity matrix is now computed in parallel according to the master slave distributed architecture, using MPI. Performance analysis, realized on two real datasets of 100 nucleotide sequences and 1049 amino-acids ones, show that the resulting library substantially outperforms the original Python package. The proposed package was also intensively evaluated on simulated and real genomic and protein data sets. The clustering results were compared to the most known traditional tools, such as UCLUST, CD-HIT and DNACLUST\nFunctions: N/A\nTopics: Small molecules\nHomepage: https://github.com/johnymatar/SpCLUST\nDocumentation: \n",

Common operations on FASTA/Q files include searching, filtering, sampling, deduplication and sorting, among others. We can find several tools in the literature for FASTA/Q file manipulation but none of them are well fitted for large files of tens of GB (likely TBs in the near future) since mostly they are based on sequential processing. The exception is seqkit that allows some routines to use a few threads but, in any case, the scalability is very limited. To deal with this issue, we introduce BigSeqKit, a parallel toolkit to manipulate FASTA/Q files at scale with speed and scalability at its core. BigSeqKit takes advantage of an HPC-Big Data framework (IgnisHPC) to parallelize and optimize the commands included in seqkit. In this way, in most cases it is from tens to hundreds of times faster than other state-of-the-art tools such as seqkit, samtools and pyfastx.\nFunctions: DNA transcription, DNA translation, Sequence conversion, Sequence trimming\nTopics: Sequence analysis\nHomepage: https://github.com/citiususc/BigSeqKit\nDocumentation: \n",

SLOW5 was developed to overcome inherent limitations in the standard FAST5 signal data format that prevent efficient, scalable analysis and cause many headaches for developers. SLOW5 can be encoded in human-readable ASCII format, or a more compact and efficient binary format (BLOW5) - this is analogous to the seminal SAM/BAM format for storing DNA sequence alignments. The BLOW5 binary format supports zlib (DEFLATE) compression, or other compression methods, thereby minimising the data storage footprint while still permitting efficient parallel access. Detailed benchmarking experiments have shown that SLOW5 format is an order of magnitude faster and significantly smaller than FAST5.\nFunctions: N/A\nTopics: N/A\nHomepage: https://github.com/hasindu2008/slow5tools\nDocumentation: \n",

Grad-seq separates native cellular lysates including complexes, according to their molecular weight and shape in a glycerol gradient, independent of charge and sequence. After this fractionation, RNA-seq and MS-analysis of each of the fractions generated allows the reconstruction of the sedimentation profiles of all detectable RNAs and protein in a single experiment.

First, multiple convolution sequence is used to extract more semantic features from the images. Second, the convolution kernel with different receptive fields is used to make features more diverse. The problem of unknown network width is alleviated by efficient integration of convolution kernel with different receptive fields. In addition, the multi-scale block is extended to other variants of the original U-Net to verify its universality. Five different medical image segmentation datasets are used to evaluate MSU-Net. A variety of imaging modalities are included in these datasets, such as electron microscopy, dermoscope, ultrasound, etc\nFunctions: Image analysis\nTopics: Echography, Electron microscopy, MRI, Medical imaging\nHomepage: https://github.com/CN-zdy/MSU_Net\nDocumentation: \n",

Triku efficiently recovers cell populations present in artificial and biological benchmarking datasets, based on mutual information and silhouette coefficient measurements. Additionally, gene sets selected by triku are more likely to be related to relevant Gene Ontology terms, and contain fewer ribosomal and mitochondrial genes.

It works by, first, computing overlaps between the long reads, in order to define an alignment pile (i.e. a set of overlapping reads used for correction) for each read. Each read's alignment pile is then further divided into smaller windows, that are corrected idependently. First, a multiple alignment strategy is used in order to compute consensus. Then, this consensus is further polished with a local de Bruijn graph, in order to get rid of the remaining errors. Additionally to error correction, CONSENT can also perform assembly polishing.\nFunctions: De-novo assembly, Local alignment, Multiple sequence alignment\nTopics: Informatics, Sequence assembly, Structure analysis\nHomepage: https://github.com/morispi/CONSENT\nDocumentation: \n",

Predicting RNA secondary structure from nucleotide sequences is a long-standing problem in genomics, but the prediction performance has reached a plateau over time. Traditional RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms are primarily based on thermodynamic models through free energy minimization. Here we propose a deep learning-based method, called UFold, for RNA secondary structure prediction, trained directly on annotated data without any thermodynamic assumptions\nFunctions: RNA secondary structure alignment, RNA secondary structure prediction, RNA structure prediction, Structure visualisation\nTopics: Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA, Gene transcripts, Machine learning, Nucleic acid structure analysis, Structure prediction\nHomepage: https://ufold.ics.uci.edu/\nDocumentation: \n",

Nevertheless, state-of-the-art methods still show deficiencies in the contact prediction of proteins with low-homology information. These top methods depend largely on statistical features that derived from homologous sequences, but previous studies, along with our analyses, show that they are insufficient for inferencing an accurate contact map for nonhomology protein targets. To compensate, we proposed a brand new single-sequence-based contact predictor (SSCpred) that performs prediction through the deep fully convolutional network (Deep FCN) with only the target sequence itself, i.e., without additional homology information. The proposed pipeline makes good use of the target sequence by utilizing the pair-wise encoding technique and Deep FCN\nFunctions: Ab initio structure prediction, Network analysis, Residue contact prediction\nTopics: Protein targeting and localisation, Sequencing, Workflows\nHomepage: http://csbio.njust.edu.cn/bioinf/sscpred/\nDocumentation: \n",

However, many practical applications in this field are limited by the available computational resources and associated long computing time needed to perform the analysis.

However, the analysis of scRNA-Seq is accompanied by many obstacles, including dropout events and the curse of dimensionality. Here, we propose the scGMAI, which is a new single-cell Gaussian mixture clustering method based on autoencoder networks and the fast independent component analysis (FastICA). Specifically, scGMAI utilizes autoencoder networks to reconstruct gene expression values from scRNA-Seq data and FastICA is used to reduce the dimensions of reconstructed data. The integration of these computational techniques in scGMAI leads to outperforming results compared to existing tools, including Seurat, in clustering cells from 17 public scRNA-Seq datasets\nFunctions: Clustering, Essential dynamics, Imputation\nTopics: Cell biology, Gene expression, RNA-Seq, Statistics and probability\nHomepage: https://github.com/QUST-AIBBDRC/scGMAI/\nDocumentation: \n",

To enable such an isoform-level analysis, a transcriptome assembly algorithm is utilized to stitch together the observed short reads into the corresponding transcripts. This task is complicated due to the complexity of alternative splicing - a mechanism by which the same gene may generate multiple distinct RNA transcripts. We develop a novel genome-guided transcriptome assembler, RefShannon, that exploits the varying abundances of the different transcripts, in enabling an accurate reconstruction of the transcripts.

As a perennial forage legume, red clover is mostly cultivated in temperate regions worldwide. Being a non-model crop species, genomic resources for red clover have been underdeveloped. Thus far, genomic analysis used in red clover has mainly relied on simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. However, SSR markers are sparse in the genome and it is often difficult to unambiguously map them using short reads generated by next generation sequencing technology. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been successfully applied in genomics assisted breeding in several agriculturally important species.\nFunctions: Genotyping, Nucleic acid feature detection, PCR primer design, SNP annotation\nTopics: Agricultural science, DNA polymorphism, Genotype and phenotype, Mapping, RNA-Seq\nHomepage: https://github.com/WLpython19/RedClover\nDocumentation: \n",

To address this question in a model organism, we have produced a gene expression profile of >90% of the individual neuron classes in the C. elegans nervous system, an ensemble of neurons for which both the anatomy and connectivity are uniquely defined at single cell resolution. We generated single cell transcriptomes for 52,412 neurons that resolve as clusters corresponding to 109 of the canonical 118 neuron classes in the mature hermaphrodite nervous system. Detailed analysis revealed molecular signatures that further subdivide identified classes into specific neuronal subtypes\nFunctions: Essential dynamics, Expression analysis\nTopics: Anatomy, Neurobiology, Transcriptomics\nHomepage: https://cengen.shinyapps.io/SCeNGEA\nDocumentation: \n",

PhySigs then solves the Tree-constrained Exposure (TE) problem for all possible clusterings of the clones that correspond to a partition of the phylogeny. The output of the TE problem is a relative exposure matrix composed of groups of identical columns corresponding to clusters of clones with identical exposures (denoted by blue and yellow).

In this work, we designed and implemented SWPepNovo, an efficient de novo peptide sequencing tool for large-scale MS/MS spectra data analysis using a novel peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) algorithm. To achieve the high performance, we designed an improved scoring algorithm to reduce the time complexity and eliminate the data dependence to enable all possible locality and vectorizations. Performance is also tuned by pre-fetching, double buffering mechanism, and an optimized memory access scheme, to achieve an optimum performance and best utilization of various computing resources within neo-heterogeneous many-core architecture\nFunctions: Peptide database search, Polymorphism detection, de Novo sequencing\nTopics: Proteomics experiment, Small molecules, Whole genome sequencing\nHomepage: https://github.com/ChuangLi99/SWPepNovo\nDocumentation: \n",

However, most proteins contain independently folding and recurring regions, domains. The domain architecture of a protein is vital for its function, and recombination events mean individual domains can have different evolutionary histories. It has previously been shown that orthologous proteins may differ in domain architecture, creating challenges for orthology inference methods operating on full-length sequences. We have developed Domainoid, a new tool aiming to overcome these challenges faced by full-length orthology methods by inferring orthology on the domain level. It employs the InParanoid algorithm on single domains separately, to infer groups of orthologous domains. RESULTS:This domain-oriented approach allows detection of discordant domain orthologs, cases where different domains on the same protein have different evolutionary histories\nFunctions: Fold recognition, Phylogenetic footprinting, Protein identification, Standardisation and normalisation\nTopics: Phylogeny, Protein folding, stability and design, Protein folds and structural domains, Sequence analysis\nHomepage: https://bitbucket.org/sonnhammergroup/domainoid/\nDocumentation: \n",

However, for most bacteria, their circular genome structure and high replication rate make reads more enriched near the replication origin. CNV detection based on read depth could be seriously influenced by such replication bias. Results We show that the replication bias is widespread using ~200 bacterial WGS data. We develop CNV-BAC that can properly normalize the replication bias as well as other known biases in bacterial WGS data and can accurately detect CNVs. Simulation and real data analysis show that CNV-BAC achieves the best performance in CNV detection compared with available algorithms.

Multiple approaches have been developed to perform such task and are often based on structural superimposition deduced from sequence alignment, which does not take into account structural features. Our methodology is based on the use of a Structural Alphabet (SA), i.e. a library of 3D local protein prototypes able to approximate protein backbone. The interest of a SA is to translate into 1D sequences into the 3D structures.

Here we present QuAdTrim, a quality control and adapter trimming algorithm for HTS data that is up to 57 times faster and uses less than 0.06% of the memory of other commonly used HTS quality control programs. QuAdTrim will reduce the time and memory required for quality control of HTS data, and in doing, will reduce the computational demands of a fundamental step in HTS data analysis.

We have developed the amplikyzer software package to address the above challenges.

In our system AIKYATAN, we annotate distal epigenomic regulatory sites, e.g., enhancers. Specifically, we develop a binary classifier that classifies genome sequences as distal regulatory regions or not, given their histone modifications' combinatorial signatures. This problem is challenging because the regulatory regions are distal to the genes, with diverse signatures across classes (e.g., enhancers and insulators) and even within each class (e.g., different enhancer sub-classes)\nFunctions: Image analysis, Post-translation modification site prediction, Transcriptional regulatory element prediction\nTopics: Epigenomics, Functional, regulatory and non-coding RNA, Machine learning, Transcription factors and regulatory sites\nHomepage: https://bitbucket.org/cellsandmachines/aikyatan\nDocumentation: \n",
